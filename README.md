## What is ShareLM?

ShareLM is a chrome plugin that makes it easy for you to contribute your own human-model interactions.

The Goal -> Collecting an ever-growing dataset of conversations, for the benefit of the open-source community ðŸ’¬ðŸ¥³

The conversations will be released with the most permissive restriction allowed by the specific model.

And this is so easy, so no excuses!

## Usage

You can use the plugin popup to go over your collected conversations from the last 24 hours and rate them. You can also use the popup to delete conversations that you donâ€™t want to share before they are pushed to the database.

You will see the green banner (and green icon) as long as you are in a supported demo. The conversations will be automatically collected and published for you.

The plugin supports ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Poe, all Gradio/ChatUI LLM demos and the others mentioned in the [list](Supported_models_and_websites.txt) -- so go try your favorite one! ðŸ¤—

## Building the Extension

To build the extension from source for a specific browser, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

### 1. Install Dependencies

From the root of the repository, run:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Build for Your Browser

**For Chrome:**
```bash
npm run build:chrome
```

**For Firefox:**
```bash
npm run build:firefox
```
These scripts configure the extension's `manifest.json` file for the target browser.

### 3. Load the Extension

After building, load the extension from the `extension/` directory.

*   **Chrome:** Go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable "Developer mode", and click "Load unpacked" to select the `extension` directory.
*   **Firefox:** Go to `about:debugging`, click "This Firefox", and click "Load Temporary Add-on" to select the `extension/manifest.json` file.

## What is unique about ShareLM?

- Supports models from different demos and platforms.
- Delayed upload to the DB so the user can see and delete their conversation if they don't want it to be published.
- The only ever-growing chat-bot conversations dataset for open-source models.

While for-profit companies collect user data through the APIs of their models, using it internally to improve their own models, the open source and research community lags behind.We introduce the ShareLM collection, a unified set of human conversations with large language models, and its accompanying plugin, a Web extension for voluntarily contributing user-model conversations. Where few platforms share their chats, the ShareLM plugin adds this functionality, thus, allowing users to share conversations from most platforms. The plugin allows the user to rate their conversations, both at the conversation and the response levels, and delete conversations they prefer to keep private before they ever leave the user's local storage."
